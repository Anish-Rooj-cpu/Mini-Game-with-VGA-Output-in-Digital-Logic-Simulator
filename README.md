ðŸŽ® Built a Mini Game with VGA Output in Digital Logic Simulator!

I'm excited to share a small project I worked on using Digital (by Neeman) â€” a logic-based game where a RED square moves on a VGA screen based on keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D)!


ðŸ›  Key Features:

i) Real-time control using keyboard input module

ii) VGA monitor output (640Ã—480\@60Hz) to display the moving square

>Modular design with:

 ðŸ”¹ KeyboardControl subcircuit to decode key inputs

 ðŸ”¹ VGA Timing subcircuit for HSync, VSync, active display area

 ðŸ”¹ Logic comparators and counters to handle movement directions


ðŸ’¡ On reset, a red square appears at the centre of the screen, and you can control it like a simple game â€” moving up, down, left, right based on your keystrokes!


This was a fun exercise in integrating:

âœ” VGA signal timing

âœ” Keyboard decoding

âœ” Logical control for motion
